By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shad~

ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line
of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw,

Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil from
the Nine Hells. You choose the devil’s type, which must
be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed
devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoc—
cupied space that you can see within range. The devil
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the
spell ends.
The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions.
Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own
turns. It is under the Dungeon Master’s control and acts
according to its nature on each of its turns, which might
result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or
trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange
for limited service. The DM has the creature’s statistics.
On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal
command to the devil (no action required by you). It
obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance
with its desires, especially if the result would
draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma
(Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check
contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the
check with advantage if you say the devil’s true name.
Ifyour check fails, the devil becomes immune to your
verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it
can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your
check succeeds, the devil carries out your command—
such as “attack my enemies,” “explore the room ahead,"
or “bear this message to the queen"—until it completes
the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having
done so.
If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its
full duration, the devil doesn‘t disappear if it has become
immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in
whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it
disappears.
Ifyou possess an individual devil’s talisman, you can
summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge
rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no
Charisma checks required.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases
by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground
of your choice that you can see within range. The area is
120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings
or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are
harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.
The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each
one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on
each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by
stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an en-
closed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of
panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel
is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel
and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the
fortress’s outer wall.
A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The
keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and
it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the
floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like,
provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The
floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its
walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have
stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep
is furnished and decorated however you like, and it con—
tains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for
up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other
objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed
from the fortress.
A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any
command given to them by creatures you designate
when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created
by the unseen servant spell.
The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone
that can be damaged. Each 10—foot—bya10-foot section of
stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing
a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might
cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the
DM’s discretion.
After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere
else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back
into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it
safely on the ground.
Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days
for a year makes the fortress permanent.

ploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a
trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for

a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can’t
be revived.
Steal Life. You can use a bonus action to drain vigor
from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you
can understand regardless of the language used. The
soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer
you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is
no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.
Borrow Experience. You can use a bonus action to
bolster yourself with the soul’s life experience, making
your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with
advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of
your next turn, it is lost.

place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible
sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane
of existence you’re currently on. The sensor remains for
as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you
were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and
auditory information from the sensor as if you were in
its space using your senses.

You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the
chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon’s type, which

shadow demon or a barlgura. The demon appears in
an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the
demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when
the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns.
When you summon it and on each of your turns thereaf—
ter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no
action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next
turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attack—
ing any creature within reach that has attacked it.
At the end of each of the demons turns, it makes a
Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage
on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed.
save, the demon continues to obey you. On a success—
ful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of
the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing
and attacking the nearest non—demons to the best of its
ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it
reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn’t
disappear for M6 rounds if it still has hit points.
As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle
on the ground with the blood used as a material com~
ponent. The circle is large enough to encompass your
space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can’t
cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone
within it. Using the material component in this manner
consumes it when the spell ends.

TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol worth at least 5 gp)
Duration: 24 hours
You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground
you can see within range. The temple must fit within an
unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side.
The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated
to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented
by the holy symbol used in the casting.
You make all decisions about the temples appearance.
The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a
roof, with one door granting access to the interior and
as many windows as you wish. Only you and any crea—
tures you designate when you cast the spell can open or
close the door.
The temple’s interior is an open space with an idol
or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is
illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light
or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air
within, and the temperature is mild.
The temple opposes types of creatures you choose
when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following:
celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a
creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple,
that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On
a failed save, it can’t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even
if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there
hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability
check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a
d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.
In addition, the sensors created by divination spells
can’t appear inside the temple, and creatures within
can’t be targeted by divination spells.
Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains
hit points from a spell of let level or higher, the creature
regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom mod—
ifier (minimum 1 hit point).
The temple is made from opaque magical force that
extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal
travel into the temples interior. Nothing can physically
pass through the temple’s exterior. It can’t be dispelled
by dispei magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A
disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a
year makes this effect permanent.
