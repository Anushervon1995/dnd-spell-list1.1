You can make the wall up to 30feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can makea ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. Thewall’s space is difficult terrain.<br>Any ranged weapon attack that enters the walls spacehas disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damageis halved if the fire effect passes through the wall toreach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that passthrough the wall cause the area of the wall they passthrough to freeze solid (at least a S-foot-square section isfrozen). Each 5-foot—square frozen section has AC 5 and15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit pointsdestroys it. When a section is destroyed, the walls waterdoesn’t fill it."
